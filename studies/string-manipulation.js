*
*  (STRING MANIPULATION)
*
*  Strings string together characters. Strings can be treated like an Array of characters. Even with an index that you can reference too. 
*
*
*  With operators  - Comparison operators can be used on string values, but Strings also work with the concatenation operator (+). Concatenation takes two String values and returns another String that is the union of the two Operand strings.
*
        var a = "Hello"
        var b = "World"
        console.log(a + " " +  b); // prints "Hello World"
        
        
*  With string methods -  Most things are objects in JavaScript. When you create a string, for example by using

        let string = 'This is my string';
        
        
*  your variable becomes a string object instance, and as a result has a large number of properties and methods available to it.
* Some examples include:
       - Retrieving a specific string character
         string[0]; //retrives first character
         string[string.length - 1]; retrieves last character.
         
         - Changing case
         let Data = "Data"
         
         data.toLowerCase() //  returns "data"
         data.toUpperCase() // returns "DATA"
         
         
         - Updating parts of a string. It takes two parameters â€” the string you want to replace, and the string you want to replace it with. Try this example:
         
         data.replace("Hello", "World");
